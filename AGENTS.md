# Agent Instructions

- Always review `TODO.md` before coding.
- Implement the first unchecked task in `TODO.md`, then mark it as done.
- After code changes, run `mvn -q package` to ensure the build succeeds.
- Keep commits small and descriptive.
- Update `DOC.md` whenever features change.
- Ensure all feature changes are reflected in DOC.md; if not, record a TODO item.
